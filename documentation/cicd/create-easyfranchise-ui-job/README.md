## Configure "Staging" in the Continuous Integration and Delivery Job

In the **Staging** part of the Continuous Integration and Delivery Job, we have to configure various things.

Configure the **General Parameters**:

1. Enter the URL to the container registry, for example <https://docker.io> for Docker Hub.
2. Enter the image name. For Docker Hub it follows this format: **"username"/"repository name"/"image-name"**. As a free Docker Hub user, you only have one private repository that you can use, therefore we are using username and repository name as image name and make the component name part of the tag. That way, we can push multiple images to the same repository.
3. Usually the tag should be your version number of the image and ideally you choose the **Tag Container Image Automatically** to make sure you receive a new version every build. But as written above, we will use the repository for more than one image and therefore select a dedicated image tag so we can better see what is happening in our registry.
4. **Container Registry Credentials**: select your already created Docker Hub credential.

Configure the **Build**:

1. Check that **Build** is switched on.
2. Enter the path to the dockerfile for the Easy Franchise UI: ```/code/easyfranchise/deployment/docker/Dockerfile-ui```

Configure **Acceptance** and **Relase**:

1. Disable the **Acceptance** step.
2. Enable the **Release** step.
3. Fill in the rest of the information:
   * Namespace: frontend
   * Deploy Tool: kubectl
   * Application Template File: ```code/easyfranchise/deployment/k8s/ui.yaml```
   * Deploy Command: apply

4. Select **Create Container Registry Secret** checkbox. This will automatically create a secret in the cluster so that the image can be pulled from your repository.
5. Choose **Create** to finish the job definition.
