# Discover the Metering Use Case

Measuring usage of a business service or application is useful for commercial purposes such as billing, license compliance and cost assessments.

Which measurable values could be used for commercial purposes depends on the business logic of your application. This value should be comprehensible for tenants (City Scooter or Bicycle Sharing). 

The number of active users seems like a good example of metering, lets have a deeper look at it. Here is the user story:

* As an SAP partner, I would like to know the number of active users per month and per tenant, so that I can check those numbers against the sold licenses and use those metrics as basis for billing.
