# Observability

Observability is the ability to inspect the internal states of a system through application logging, metrics and tracing. It provides key insights into distributed applications for faster problem identification and resolution. In this chapter, we will explore how to access application logs and typical cluster metrics using functionality built-in to Kyma. Also, we will use open source tooling to collect custom metrics as well and/or collect them outside the actual cluster.
